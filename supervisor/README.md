## Supervisor Buildfile for Docker

`Docker` containers naturally contains only one process.
Sometimes, that's good enough. Sometimes, you get a head-ache
with process mangling ([MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS][1]).

So we will run a container that run multiple processed inside...

## Environments

* `SUPERVISOR_LOG_LEVEL`: logging level. Default: `info`.

## Volumes

* `/supervisor/`: All logs generated by main and sub processes.
* `/etc/s.supervisord/`: Partial configuration included by `superivosrd`.
  Any `*.s` (please note, not `*.conf`) will be loaded by `supervisord`.

## Generators

Before starting the main daemon, the script `/supervisor.sh` will
execute every `*.sh` found under `/etc/s.supervisor/` directory.
The purpose is to create a dynamic configuration for `supervisor`.

## Note

To avoid long typing, a symbolic link `/usr/bin/s` is created
for `/usr/bin/supervisorctl`. Now you can type, e.g, `s status`.
