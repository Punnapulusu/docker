## Supervisor Buildfile for Docker

`Docker` containers naturally contains only one process.
Sometimes, that's good enough. Sometimes, you get a head-ache
with process mangling ([MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS][1]).

So we will run a container that run multiple processed inside...

## Environments

* `SUPERVISOR_PASSWD`: the password for the web console. By default,
  a random password is generated and printed to `stderr`, which you
  can retrieve by `docker logs` and `grep` commands.

* `SUPERVISOR_LOG_LEVEL`: logging level. Default: `info`.

## Exposed port

* `9001`: Accessing to web console of `supervisor` daemon

## Volumes

* `/supervisor/`: All logs generated by main and sub processes.
* `/etc/s.supervisord/`: Partial configuration included by `superivosrd`
